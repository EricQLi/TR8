## Catminat database

	Thanks to the `readxl` package, now the dataset (which is in
    `xlsx` format) can be read without external dependencies
    (i.e. users do not have to worry about installing `perl`)

## BROT and PLANTS traitbases


     Two new databases are added as sources of data: BROT (mainly related to mediterranean
     species) and PLANTS (from USA).
