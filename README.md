R package for downloading functional traits data for plant species


Plant ecologists often need to collect "traits" data about plant species which are 
often scattered among various databases: TR8 contains a set of tools which take care of
automatically retrieving some of those functional traits data for plant species from 
the following publicly available databases:

* [Biolflor](http://www2.ufz.de/biolflor/index.jsp)
* [The Ecological Flora of the British Isles](http://www.ecoflora.co.uk/)
* [LEDA traitbase](http://www.leda-traitbase.org/LEDAportal/)
* Ellenberg values for Italian Flora
* [Mycorrhizal intensity database](http://esapubs.org/Archive/ecol/E093/059/default.htm)
* [MycolFlor](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/12-1700.1)

 A basic guide for using the package is provided in [TR8.pdf](https://github.com/GioBo/TR8/blob/master/vignettes/TR8.pdf)
