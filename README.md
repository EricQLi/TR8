TR8
===

R package for downloading functional traits data for plant species


Plant ecologists often need to collect "traits" data about plant species which are 
often scattered among various databases: TR8 contains a set of tools which take care of
automatically retrieving some of those functional traits data for plant species from 
publicly available databases (Biolflor, The Ecological Flora of the British Isles, 
LEDA traitbase, Ellenberg values for Italian Flora, Mycorrhizal intensity database).
